# Medical Insurance Prediction with Gradient Boosting Regressor and Streamlit

## Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various features using the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm. Additionally, a Streamlit web application is developed to provide insurance cost predictions and policy suggestions based on the model's output.

## Features

- Medical insurance cost prediction using Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Streamlit app for easy interaction and visualization
- Policy suggestions based on the predicted insurance costs

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals, including age, BMI, smoking habits, etc. The goal is to predict the medical insurance cost for each individual based on these features.
